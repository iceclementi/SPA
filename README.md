# Static Program Analyser (SPA)

An **SPA** is an interactive tool that automatically answers queries about programs. This implementation of the program processes a SIMPLE source file provided by the user. and extracts and stores relevant design abstractions. Users can then ask questions about the input source in Program Query Language (PQL). The program will answer the users' queries  based on its stored design abstractions.

The full wiki of the functionalities of the implemented SPA can be viewed [here](https://github.com/nus-cs3203/project-wiki/wiki/Full-(Basic-and-Advanced)-SPA-requirements).

The team's report can be viewed [here](/Team09-Report.pdf).
